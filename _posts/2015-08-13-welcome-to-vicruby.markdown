VicRuby has been around in some shape or form since 2006. It's had ups and downs in activity throughout the years. Coordinating has mostly been done through [our Google Groups page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vicruby) and word-of-mouth between members. We've never had a permanent place on the web for news and general information. With the support of our small community, this website will aim to achieve just that.

This site is very much a work-in-progress. You can view the [repository for the website on GitHub](https://github.com/matharvard/vicruby). Feel free to submit a pull request with improvements!
